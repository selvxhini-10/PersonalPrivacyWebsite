        <p>Mass surveillance is now more accessible, efficient, convenient and cheaper than ever. According to a United
          Nations report, digital technologies can effectively be used for mass surveillance, spyware, control and
          oppression. Surveillance and spyware tools such as the “Pegasus” software, developed by the Israeli company
          NSO Group, can be remotely installed on mobile phones to eavesdrop, harvest data and secretly spy and track
          politicians, citizens, government officials and human rights activists. The spyware can covertly monitor
          calls, text messages, locations and passwords without the knowledge of the device owner.

    <p>While this intrusion may be justified in fighting crime, the software frequently targets innocent individuals who
      have little involvement with crime. This clear invasion of privacy demonstrates the many ways in which technology
      can be misused for unethical and unreasonable ways to access and monitor people’s personal lives without consent.

    <h3>Understanding the Practices in Workplace Surveillance Technology </h3>
    <!-- Describe implications -->
    <p><br>Individuals entering the workforce can expect to be surveilled. Corporations are utilizing surveillance and
      sensor technology to monitor workers in an attempt to ensure productivity and efficiency, which raises concerns
      about the invasion of privacy and mistrust between employers and employees at work.
      Electronic surveillance and monitoring can lead to negative mental health and psychological effects, particularly
      in corporate workplaces. <b>56% of workers</b> who are monitored by their employer experience <b>tension or
        stress</b> at work. Surveillance tools like <i>GPS tracking, recording conversations, email and app
        monitoring</i> can result in decreased employee morale, feelings of distrust, lack of transparency and privacy,
      and loss of integrity and autonomy for workers. In fact, studies show that electronic monitoring has no positive
      benefits and contributes to a damaged workplace and counterproductive behaviour (i.e. employees are more likely to
      cheat, work slower and slack off), and therefore, the costs outweigh any potential benefits.

      <!-- Analyze consequences and implications -->

        <h1 align="left" style="color:#008080">Why Does this Matter?</h1>

        <p>As technology becomes increasingly intrusive, workers are victims of inappropriate and invasive surveillance
          technology. Workplace surveillance, if necessary, should be done with transparency, ethics and consent for a
          more productive and efficient workforce, but these cases demonstrate illegitimate tracking and monitoring done
          without consent outside working hours.

          <!-- Emphasize invasion of privacy due to excessive monitoring-->
          <br><br>Limited consent and excessive monitoring and data collection without justified reason violate personal
          privacy and contribute to a dystopian workforce where workers no longer feel safe. Technology has the
          potential to revolutionize the workforce for the better and ensure workers can feel safe and exercise personal
          autonomy. It’s time that digital surveillance tools and other technology are employed such that personal
          privacy is not compromised.
