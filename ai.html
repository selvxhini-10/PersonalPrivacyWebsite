        <h3>Identifying the concerns surrounding Artificial Intelligence</h3>

        <p>Data privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent due to the advancement of <b>generative artificial
            intelligence.</b> AI systems often collect, process and store substantial amounts of personal information to
          train their algorithms, improve performance and make predictions. This raises privacy concerns, particularly
          concerning the usage of personal data. This personal data can be embedded in language models and cannot be
          easily removed from the system. This presents a significant challenge as AI increases the risks of
          inadvertently exploiting confidential information about individuals and allowing unauthorized access to
          personal information. Databases of personal data fallen into the wrong hands of a cybercriminal could also
          lead to identity theft, cyberbullying and harassment. <br>

        <p><br>In particular, one application of artificial intelligence algorithms includes <b>facial recognition
            technology</b>, which can exacerbate privacy issues due to the lack of consent and transparency regarding
          the usage of these systems. Machine learning has evolved to capture individual facial features to verify or locate
          their identity in databases, leading to many ethical and legal privacy concerns about individuals being
          tracked and identified without their knowledge or consent. From unlocking an iPhone to using filters on
          Snapchat, facial recognition systems are prevalent in society today, and can be intrusive and invasive when
          used for exploiting and tracking people. Explore some examples and implications of how artificial intelligence
          systems can negatively impact society.

            <p>Databases of facial images, addresses and photos contain sensitive information about individuals, which
              can
              be vulnerable to exploitation and data breaches. Cybercriminals and malicious actors could hack this
              database and gain access to facial recognition data for identity theft, stalking, deepfakes, robbery,
              harassment, impersonation and online scamming. Since faces cannot be encrypted to keep them secure like
              other types of data, they remain unprotected and AI makes it convenient to capture facial images to link
              them to individuals. This democratization of personal data collection undermines individual privacy and
              freedom in society. </p>

            <p>Facial recognition is prone to inherent judgemental bias and prejudice against marginalized groups,
              especially women and people of colour, due to biased training data and programming. As a result, people
              can be misidentified, convicted and wrongly accused of committing crimes — which can significantly alter
              their lives, create long-term psychological trauma and ruin their self-worth and reputation. Authoritative
              regimes can also abuse this technology to detect and target ethnic minorities. For example, China’s Huawei
              developed facial recognition software to identify and report Uighurs to government officials. This misuse
              of AI demonstrates how misidentification and inherent biases in technology systems can harm society’s most
              vulnerable groups and enable authoritative regimes to invade privacy and commit genocide and acts of
              violence.</p>

            <p>Facial recognition and AI systems are an evident infringement of personal privacy, expression and
              freedom. The thought of being monitored and surveilled can cause negative psychological effects, emotional
              stress and erode trust between people and the social fabric. People will feel discouraged and unmotivated
              from political activism due to their lack of privacy. For example, AI is used for mass surveillance and
              population control in demonstrations and protests, especially in totalitarian countries. During 2020, the
              San Francisco Police Department accessed over 400 cameras to spy on protestors, exemplifying that
              technologies can often be manipulated to restrict people’s freedom of speech and expression and right to
              anonymity.

      <ul>
        <li>Anti recognition makeup / Face covering or masks
          <ul>

            <li>Consider wearing a mask in locations where facial recognition is being used</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Opt out of facial scans
          <ul>
            <li>You have a choice in opting out of facial recognition scans at airports and other institutions </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Limit posting and tagging on social media
          <ul>
            <li>Every social media profile creates a risk for privacy breaches. For example, Clearview AI created a
              facial
              recognition app to view all public pictures of a person on social media.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Be aware of smart home devices
          <ul>
            <li>Google Nest Hub Max has a built-in Face Match technology that allows you to unlock your smart home
              device
              with your face. Face Match scans your environment and faces to display personalized content to each
              person.
              It’s advised to turn off this feature.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Don’t share confidential personal information with AI chatbots, algorithms or forums </li>
